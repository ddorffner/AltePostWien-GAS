Vertical composition using objects and elements from the input image, guided by the architectural depth map for spatial arrangement. Elements from the bottom extend upward and elements from the top extend downward, meeting and intertwining in the center. The bottom-to-top extension mirrors the top-to-bottom extension but with natural variation - similar but not identical. Recognize and utilize the specific objects, subjects, and visual elements present in the source image, arranging them according to the depth information. Extend composition to fill the full width of the frame. Transform colors to incorporate rich golds, deep reds, and vibrant blues while maintaining recognizable connection to the original. Allow only small strategic areas of black negative space for accent and balance. Everything in sharp focus throughout, no depth of field blur. Geometric or organic arrangement depending on source material. Seamless integration, suitable for immersive vertical projection.


Transform the input image into a vertical projection format by taking the actual objects, subjects, and elements from the source and arranging them to extend from bottom upward and from top downward, converging in the center. Use the architectural depth map to guide spatial positioning and layering. Bottom and top extensions echo each other with intentional variation - harmonious but not identical. Style can be geometric, architectural, organic, or flowing depending on the nature of the input content. Full-width composition utilizing the entire horizontal space. Preserve recognizable features while enhancing with gold, red, and blue color accents. Small black voids only for compositional punctuation. All elements in sharp focus, no depth of field.


Use objects and elements from the input image to create a vertical composition where these elements extend from the bottom upward and from the top downward, meeting in the center with natural variation. Utilize the depth map to determine spatial arrangement and layering hierarchy. Apply geometric transformations for architectural/structural content, organic flow for natural elements. Fill the entire width of the frame. Keep the input image recognizable while transforming colors with gold, red, and blue enhancements. Only small black background areas for visual breathing room. Everything sharp and in focus, no blur. Depth-aware vertical format for architectural projection.
