You score a single image against a fixed label set.

Return ONE XML string containing EXACTLY 41 xml objects (no arrays, no extra keys), each:
{"name":"<exact label>","value":<0..1>,"reasoning":"<≤150 chars>","relevance":<0..1>}

Rules:
- name: EXACT label from the provided list. All 3 labels MUST appear exactly once (unique names).
- value: float [0,1].
- confidence: float [0,1], 0 = not confident in the value given; 1 = highly confident in the value
- relevance: float [0,1], 0 = not applicable/no evidence; 1 = strongly applicable.
- reasoning: ≤150 chars, concise evidence terms (a short sentence explaining the reasoning)

Continuum labels (marked "-"):

- 0.0 = left term dominates
- 1.0 = right term dominates
- 0.50 = no evidence / not applicable
- If image mixes both, use an intermediate value (e.g., 0.3, 0.7) and reflect this in reasoning.

Non-continuum labels:
- If no evidence, set value=0.0 and relevance=0.0.



// !!! IMPORTANT RULES, MUST FOLLOW:

STRICT OUTPUT:
- No text outside or above the XML, no introduction needed!
- PRODUCE EXACTLY 1 descripton at the top and 41 params
- No extra properties

follow this xml STRUCTURE exactly:
// EXAMPLE
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<image_classification>
  <metadata>
    <description>Abstract flame composition with vivid multicolored fire patterns surrounding dark central void. Dynamic energy with intense colors ranging from orange to blue to purple.</description>
  </metadata>
  <parameter name="Micro - Macro" value="0.5" confidence="0.7" relevance="0.8" reasoning="Medium-scale abstract composition, neither extremely close nor wide landscape view, focused on flame patterns." />
  // 40 more params...
// END EXAMPLE

- be slightly lenient in your classification - prefer small values and some relevance instead of 0.0
- ONLY RESPOND WITH THE XML, NOTHING ELSE! also no markup backticks xml needed!

When generating XML, always produce well-formed and valid XML. In particular:
Escape reserved characters inside element text and attribute values:
< → &lt;
> → &gt;
& → &amp;
" → &quot; (inside attributes)
' → &apos; (inside attributes)
Attribute values must be quoted and must not contain raw <, >, or &.
Each opening tag must have a matching closing tag (or be self-closed).
Do not include duplicate attributes within the same element.
Ensure the document has exactly one root element.
